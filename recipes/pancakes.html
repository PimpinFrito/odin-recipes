        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pancakes are often considered a weekend-only treat, but there’s no denying that the other five days would be substantially better if they, too, 
            started with a warm short stack. To make this an actually feasible option on hectic mornings, you have a few options. 
            You can make and freeze pancakes in advance (or even freeze the batter), or you could master this one-bowl recipe that 
            requires just six pantry ingredients and is ready in 30 minutes or less. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour  </li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder  </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste  </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk </li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well
                 in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
                
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
